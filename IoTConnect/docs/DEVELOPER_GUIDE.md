## Introduction

This document aims to provide a step-by-step-guide way to develop firmware with the
[B-U585I-IOT02A STM32U4 Discovery kit for IoT](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-u585i-iot02a.html) board 
with IoTConnect.

The project development is currently supported only on Windows.

* Download and install either [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (Select to install Git Bash in the Setup Wizard). 
[MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) 
may also work, but are not primarily tested.
* You can use git command line or a different tool that can clone Git repositories with submodule support.
* Install [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) 
and [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) 
Version 2.10 or greater.

### Project Setup

* Clone this repo into a directory, preferably at the root of C: or another drive.
Windows has a path name limit of 256 characters which can cause the build to fail,
as some of the source files are deeply nested into directories.
* Download the [X-CUBE-AZURE Expansion Package](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-azure.html) version 2.3.0, 
and place the zip into the the root directory of this cloned repository.
* In a bash shell, execute setup-project.sh. For example, if this repo is cloned into
C:\iotc-azuretos-stm32-u5

```shell
cd /c/iotc-azuretos-stm32-u5
IoTConnect/scripts/setup-project.sh 
```

### Project Build

The software must be built and programmed onto the board by using the following steps:

* Download, install and open the [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html).
* Choose an arbitrary workspace path to use for the project when prompted.
* In STM32CubeIDE, select *File -> Open Projects from File System*.
* Select **Projects/B-U585I-IOT02A/Applications/TFM_Azure_IoT**.
* Uncheck the **TFM_Azure_IoT** top level root project and leave the other projects checked like this:

![Import Project Screenshot](media/import-project-tfm.png "Import Project Screenshot]")
* If you wish to build for BG96 Cellular Module support, change the build configuration
from the default *Release_WiFi* configuration to *Release_BG96* by right clicking the
TFM_Appli/TFM_Appl_NonSecure project in the project explorer and navigating 
to *Build Configurations -> Set Active* to *Release_BG96*. 
See the [BG96 Guide](BG96.md) for more information.

* Build the TFM_Appli/TFM_Appli_Secure project. This will trigger the build for all other components
except for the Non-Secure application.
* After the Secure build completes, build the TFM_Appli/TFM_Appl_NonSecure project.
Though this build depends on TFM_Appli_Secure, the direct build dependency is removed in order to 
save on compilation when developing the application.
* Once the application builds successfully:
    * Switch the board into TFM mode by executing (double-click in the IDE) regression.sh 
        in the TFM_SBSFU_Boot project.
        Once this script is executed, the board will no longer run non-TFM applications.
        If you wish to undo this action and re-enable non-TFM project support, you can 
        execute the STM32U5_TrustZone_Disable.sh script.
    * Run TFM_UPDATE.sh from the <> project. This will upload all built components.
    * In the future, if you make only non-secure application changes, you can run APP_UPDATE_NS.sh instead.

* If you wish to debug the application, you can attach the debugger to a 
running application with the provided debug launch script.

### IoTConnect Subscription Information

[IoTConnect](https://iotconnect.io) is available as a SaaS hosted subscription service or available as a PaaS subscription hosted on a client's infrastructure. SaaS IoTConnect subscriptions are available for business and personal accounts, and both are deployed on a production cloud instance.  Personal accounts are currently available through a North American instance of IoTConnect built on Microsoft Azure and is available for global use.  Personal IoTConnect accounts support between 1 and 100 devices, and can be setup in minutes through credit card payment on [IoTConnect Subscription Site](https://subscription.iotconnect.io/subscribe). Business SaaS accounts are available on both AWS and Azure, and deployed on EMEA and North American instances.  The Business SaaS platforms will support 1 to over a million devices, allow unlimited users, and can be setup in 1-business day through your local Avnet, Avnet Silica, Avnet Abacus, and EBV Elektronik account managment team. If you are not connected to an Avnet representative already, one can be reached by the "Contact Us" link on the Subscription Page. PaaS subscriptions are available in all Azure and AWS serviced regions, and require an Avnet license agreement and a cloud subscription service through Anvet or directly through the cloud sevices provider. 

For registration, you will need an email address, phone number, and unique company name. When you sign up for an account, you are creating an organizational instance.  You can add others later into this account with various permissions, including admistrative rights.  But note that users within the same organization, as well as device users, do not require their own seperate IoTConnect subscriptions.   

**IoTConnect Trial Account**  
A 2-Month Test Drive is available through the [IoTConnect Subscription Site](https://subscription.iotconnect.io/subscribe).  This version allows up to 5 devices, 5 users, and 30K messages per month, and does not require creditcard information for registration.  In addition, all paid tiers provide a 1-month trial period. The second month will be billed 30-days after sign-up and can be cancelled anytime through the [subcription management portal](https://subscription.iotconnect.io).

### Device Setup

* A serial console application, such as [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en),
 or a browser application like [Google Chrome Labs Serial Terminal](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/serial-terminal/)
 is required for the next steps. 
 Configure settings per the screenshot below:

![Tera Term Serial Settings](media/teraterm-settings.png "Tera Term Serial Settings")

Follow the [Device Configuration section of the QuickStart Guide](QUICKSTART.md#device-configuration)

### IoTConnect Template Setup with Pre-made import
A Device Template with Self Signed authentication type will need to be imported.
* Download the premade [Device Template with Self-Signed Auth](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/main/documentation/templates/devices/stm32u5/stm32u5self_signed_template.JSON).
* Import the template into your IoTConnect instance. (A guide on [Importing a Device Template](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/main/documentation/iotconnect/import_device_template.md) is available or for more information on [Template Management](https://docs.iotconnect.io/iotconnect/user-manuals/devices/template-management/), please see the [IoTConnect Documentation](https://iotconnect.io) website.)

### Using OTA or ADU
When updating the firmware with OTA or ADU, make sure to use the *Projects\B-U585I-IOT02A\Applications\TFM_Azure_IoT\TFM_Appli\Binary\tfm_ns_app_enc_sign.bin* file.

### Troubleshooting
* Output stopping with a message about "IP Address":  Ensure valid WiFI credentials are used and that the network has an operational DHCP server.
* Output stopping before data is sent:  Verify CPID and Environment names.
* Output stopping with "No Device Found":  Ensure a new device was created in the portal and that the DUID matches the Device ID
* When flashing the board for the first time, you may encounter an error *Error while initializing the security counter*. In that case, reset the board. 
* A firmware update with *tfm-update.bat* may fail with an error *[ERR] Unable to find bootable image* during startup. Running *tfm-update.bat* and then *trust-zone-enable.bat* again should clear the error.
* After an update, you may see an error in the log *[ERR] Error while initializing the security counter*. Simply resetting the board should clear the error.
* A blank screen may appear after flashing. The following steps may recover the board:
  * Erase the board using the full chip erase option using the STM32CubeProgrammer GUI.
  * Run *STM32U5_TrustZone_Disable.sh* and then *regression.sh* again.
  * Flash the board again with *TFM_UPDATE.sh*.
